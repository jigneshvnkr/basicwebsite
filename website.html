    <!-- 20 Top Frontend Technologies to Use in 2022 -->

        <h1>20 Top Frontend Technologies to Use in 2022</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Firstly, let’s ask what exactly “top” means? For some of us it means “the newest.”

                Can’t argue with that but, at the same time, you have to keep in mind that it can also refer to the
                popularity of a particular technology. Considering that, we should also count CSS and HTML as top
                technologies, right? The point is that they are not that young and new anymore but still — super
                important, and you need to use them on a daily basis.

                In this blog post, I have prepared a combination of popular, new, and “fundamental” technologies so that
                you can build an image of the situation in the market.</p>

            <h3>1. <a href="#">HTML</a> (HyperText Markup Language)</h3>
            <figure style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="https://www.w3.org/html/logo/img/mark-word-icon.png" alt="" srcset="">
                <figcaption>HTML</figcaption>
                <!-- <span>HTMl</span> -->

            </figure>
            <p>Let’s start with the fundamentals. HTML is the core of frontend development and this situation is not
                going to change anytime soon. Thanks to this technology, you are able to create the “skeleton” or —
                using other words — the “markup” for your website. HTML elements provide you with options to add
                buttons, forms, containers, and much more.</p>
            <h3>2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h3>
            <p>Another “core” frontend technology. CSS helps you to create some additional styling rules to the
                previously created HTML structure. Besides that, proper CSS rules make your web application responsive
                (so it looks good on every screen size and device) and more interactive with some eye-catching
                animations.</p>
            <h3>3. JavaScript</h3>
            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that was, is, and will be, one of the most important frontend
                technologies. It allows you to dynamically modify the contents of your app or website.

                That means that whatever feature you are considering on the frontend side of the application — you can
                implement that in JavaScript. That includes, e.g., a shopping cart on your web store, complex
                animations, an app that counts your taxes, web browser games, and anything else that you usually see on
                the web — it’s most likely done with help of JavaScript technology.</p>
